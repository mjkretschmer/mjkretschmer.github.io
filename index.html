<p>I am a PhD student in mathematics at the University of Chicago as of Fall 2023, now working with <a href = "https://math.uchicago.edu/~mem/">Maryanthe Malliaris</a>. Before that, I was an undegraduate at UC Berkeley. My interests are broadly in logic and algebra, and specifically in the model theory of fields (with order, derivation, etc) and its connections to algebraic geometry and differential algebra. </p>

<h3>Papers</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
  <i>Infinitary logic has no expressive efficiency over finitary logic</i> <br> with <a href="https://homepages.math.uic.edu/~mht/">Matthew Harrison-Trainor</a> -
  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05615">[arXiv]</a> <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/infinitary-logic-has-no-expressive-efficiency-over-finitary-logic/6795D48C78D52B3313FB9D62609B79C9">[Journal]</a> <br>
  This was based on my research during the 2022 University of Michigan REU, summarized in this <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/content/dam/math-assets/reu-su22/Miles,%20Kretschmer.REU2022.pdf">report</a>.

<p>For Fall 2024, I am a college fellow for Math 277, Mathematical Logic I. </p> 
	<ul>
		<li>Monday Office Hours: 3:00 - 4:00 in RY 253A</li>
		<li>Monday Problem Session: 4:00 - 5:00 in RY 235A</li>
		<li>Friday Office Hours: 3:00 - 4:00 in RY 235B</li>

<p>Additionally I teach for <a href = "https://mathcirclesofchicago.org">Math Circles of Chicago</a>, at the Back of the Yards Hub.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Writing & Notes</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Complete Intersections in Projective Space - <a href = "pdfs\Complete_Intersections.pdf">[pdf]</a>
	<br> This was adapted from a term paper I wrote at UC Berkeley. It covers the Hilbert polynomial, B&#233;zout's Theorem for complete intersections, and the twisted cubic.
	</li>
	
	<li>Notes on the Baldwin-Lachlan proof - <a href="pdfs\baldwin-lachlan.pdf">[pdf]</a>
	<br> A relatively terse sketch of the Baldwin-Lachlan proof of Morley's Theorem, prepared for a presentation to the student logic seminar.
	</li>
	
	<li>Notes on Cut Elimination - <a href = "pdfs\Cut_Elimination.pdf">[pdf]</a>
	<br> An introductory talk on the sequent calculus from the point of view of structural proof theory.
	</li>
	
	<li> A Quasi-random Graph Sequence - <a href = "pdfs\quasirandom.pdf">[pdf]</a>
	<br> Quasi-random graph sequences defined in terms of (matrices over) finite fields and the Artin-Schreier map.
	</li>
